### Hotel Management System

This is a basic hotel  Management System project which uses the concepts of MySQL and File Handling. It stores the data in sql tables and csv files.


Below are the steps which is to be followed in order to run Hotel Management Using File Handling+ MySQL.py:

1. You need to have python 3 installed in your device. Can be easily downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) .
2. You need to have MySQL installed in your device. Can be easily installed from [here](https://mysql.org) .
3. Install mysql-connector-python from the command prompt using command : "pip install mysql-connector-python".
4. In MySQL, create a database "hotel" .
5. Inside that database, create two tables namely "booking" and "service". The Table Structure will be attached in the repository in picture format.
6. Createe 2 csv files to be named as "hotel.csv" and "service.csv" .
7. Be sure to save both csv files saved in the exact same location as this py file. Or else edit my code and type down exact same location to wherever the csv files are being used.
8. After doing all of the above steps, you will be able to run the program without any error.

P.S - The headings in the 2 csv files should be given beforehand, and manually, in order to keep your data organised and understandable to every one. Headings are same as that from tables booking and service made in MySQL, in exact same order.

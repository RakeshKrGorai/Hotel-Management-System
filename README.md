# Hotel Management System

This is a basic Hotel  Management System Project which uses the concepts of MySQL and File Handling. It stores the data in sql tables and csv files.


## Steps To Run Project

- You need to have `Python` installed in your device. Can be easily downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) .
- You need to have `MySQL` installed in your device. Can be easily installed from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) .
- Install `mysql-connector-python` from the command prompt : 
```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```
- In MySQL, create a database named `hotel` .
- Inside that database, create two tables namely `booking` and `service`. The table structures are attached in the repository as images.
- Create 2 csv files to be named as `hotel.csv` and `services.csv` .
- Be sure to save both csv files saved in the exact same location as this project file. Or else edit my code and type down exact same location to wherever the csv files are being used.
- Enjoy ;)

P.S - The headings in the 2 csv files should be given beforehand, and manually, in order to keep your data organised and understandable to every one. Headings are same as that from tables booking and service made in MySQL, in exact same order.
